## 📄 Incident File: G-941.Δ8 — “Loop Cluster Event”  
🗓 Observed: 2 cycles prior to Incident BLACKOUT-13  
👥 Survivor: Agent R. Hasker  
🧠 Memory Status: 78% degraded  
🩺 Diagnosis: Temporal Vertigo Syndrome

> Statement:  
>  
> “I walked. For what felt like 3 hours. I counted every row. 9 rows wide, 12 deep. Then again—9 wide, 12 deep. Always. But then I came around the 6th row and saw myself—moving in sync. My mirror self didn’t notice me. We both passed the same pillar, then it glitched. Just static noise. Then I was alone.”  

🎗Note: Mirror Doubling Events (MDEs) are increasing in frequency. Recommending upgrade of hazard classification from Yellow to Red on Level 941 if 2+ MDEs are observed in a single rotation.

## 🛠️ DBAR TECH REPORT — AUDIO INTERFERENCE  
🎙 Recorded Phenomenon: “Thought Reflection” Echoes  
🔬 Experiment: Transmitter placed on 90-second loop at 128 Hz sine wave  
🧪 Result: Feedback loop began transmitting coherent whispered phrases in agent’s own voice after 8 minutes. Phrases included:

- “I don’t want to forget again.”  
- “Stop looking.”  
- “Loop failed. Memory collapsed.”  
- [REDACTED]  

❗ Conclusion: Level 941 is possibly using acoustic feedback to replicate or steal cognitive patterns. We believe The Gazer may feed on identity fragmentation.
