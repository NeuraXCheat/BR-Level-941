## LEVEL: 941  
### CODENAME: “The Hold”  
**CLASSIFICATION:** LEVEL 4 – EYES ONLY  
**DATE OF INITIAL DISCOVERY:** [REDACTED]  
**AUTHORIZING OFFICER:** Director E. Lorran, DBAR Division 7

## 🧱 Description

Level 941, nicknamed “The Hold,” is an expansive subterranean environment structurally resembling a multilevel parking garage. The space lacks all identifying signage, exits, and entrances. No vehicles or infrastructure appear functional or intact.

Rows of concrete pillars repeat in a disquieting geometric grid beneath flickering, yellow-stained fluorescent lights. No sunlight reaches this level. No time cycle exists.

- Ambient temperature: ~64°F (17.7°C), unwavering  
- Ambient scent: Rust, damp concrete, faint ozone  
- Sound: Echoing footsteps extend unnaturally long  
- Surface texture: Slightly wet or clammy, without explanation

## 🌀 Anomalous Phenomena

- ⏳ **Temporal Instability:** Watches desync within minutes. Reported time spent here ranges from 5 minutes to 3 days—with no biological change observed.
- 🧠 **Memory Drift:** After 2+ hours, wanderers begin experiencing name confusion, déjà vu, and partial amnesia.
- 🔄 **Auditory Recursion:** Footsteps echo in incorrect directions. Some whisper-like sounds repeat what the wanderer hasn't said yet.
- 🧭 **The Pull:** A directional compulsion begins subtly after extended exposure. Yielding to it leads to isolated areas, usually followed by sightings of Entity 941-A.

## 👁️‍🗨️ ENTITY 941-A: “The Gazer”

A tall, emaciated humanoid with skeletal limbs and glowing, spherical eyes. It appears to stalk wanderers without direct pursuit—always behind pillars or flickering lights.

- When looked at directly, it **freezes**, but local lighting dims.
- Eye contact triggers memory-loop hallucinations.
- It **never blinks**. The hum of electricity follows it.

🛑 Survival Tips:

- Avoid mirrors, standing water, or polished metal surfaces. They may reflect The Gazer before it's visible.
- Do not break movement rhythm (ex: Left, left, straight, right). Rhythm deviation = increased encounter rate.
- Maximum safe exposure: 8–10 hours (neurological risk increases exponentially after that).

## 🧾 Field Log Excerpt (Redacted)

> “...the light flickered blue this time. I took the chance. But before I could move, I heard my name whispered... only I hadn’t spoken it aloud. That was when I saw it watching. Not hunting. Just... memorizing me.”

## 🏚️ Origins & Theories

Some encrypted artifacts on Level 188 refer to a “Gray Domain” used to extract memory traces from living entities. Some DBAR researchers speculate The Hold is a failed memory server—left behind after an interdimensional collapse.

Its grid-like structure may be an artifact of a Fractal Fault Event, where a collapsed level fragmented and was stitched into pocket dimensions like 941.

Graffiti in multiple scripts suggests prior civilizations have passed through or were born within The Hold. Many simply read:

> “Don’t let it see your thoughts.”

## 🚪 Entrances

- Falling asleep near large HVAC units in Level 20  
- Certain elevators in Level 4 that descend more than 24 floors  
- Mislabelled fire exits marked “P2” in Level 9

---

## 🔚 Exits

- Locate flickering fluorescents with a faint blue pulse; standing beneath them while holding still may transfer you to Level 89 or 0.
- Rare staircases labelled “MAINT A” may lead to active vertical shafts.

Exit chances are unreliable.

## ⚠️ Notes & Redactions

- Graffiti variations include “HE HEARS THE LOOP,” “STAY LEFT,” and “GAZE RETURNED = GAZE CLAIMED.”
- Anomaly Report 941-B indicates walls briefly displayed digital timestamps—possibly displaced memories—before vanishing.
- Document 941-Δ was recovered showing a 5th-dimensional schematic resembling this layout. Partially translated symbols suggest the Gazer is not alone.

## 🛡️ End of File  
All wanderer briefings should include psychological prep and memory anchors before entry into 941.
